#### Brief Description of Project -  

Southern Agro Serve is a pioneer when it comes to the supply and distribution of various agricultural products and related hardware equipment in the Galle district. Established in 1998 in the Bereliyadola Estate in Hapugala, Wakwella, Southern Agro Serve has been able to dominate the market and improve its popularity among its faithful customers over the years due to the supply of products with the highest quality standards, thereby improving customer satisfaction day by day.  

As our client’s business grew over the years and increased its area of operations throughout the country, new challenges were met by our client. This expansion of our client’s business increased the complexity of the company’s daily business operations and a need for a system to mitigate and deal with the complexity of everyday business functions was felt thoroughly. Our client experienced many operational issues in the areas of managing deliveries, managing customers and their orders, managing payments, managing employees, keeping track of inventories, managing suppliers as well as managing vehicles. As the decision was made by our client to implement a system when we were having a discussion with him on how we can help provide responses to the issues identified above we were tasked with the job of developing a web application to solve his crisis. 

The Business Management System developed for Southern Agro Serve (Pvt) Ltd. Allows our client to handle all business activities related to his company online, thus sparing him from wasting his valuable time managing the business functions manually which can prove to be a very tedious task. Our client is provided with the luxury of managing the entire system with just the click of a button very efficiently and transparently by the web application. Our automated system keeps track of delivery management, customer and customer order management, user management, payment management, employee management, inventory control management, supplier management as well as vehicle management. 

Hence, the system proves to be the ideal solution for our client as well as his staff to efficiently manage and keep track of the daily activities of Southern Agro Serve more efficiently sparring much valuable time.
